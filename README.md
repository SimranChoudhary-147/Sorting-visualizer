# Sorting-visualizer
This is a simple visualizer for the bubble sort algorithm, created using C++ and the GLUT library. The purpose of this project is to provide a visual
representation of how the bubble sort algorithm works and how it sorts an array.

How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the project in your C++ IDE.
Build and run the project.
Click the "Generate New Array" button to create a new random array of numbers.
Click the "Sort" button to sort the array using the bubble sort algorithm.
Watch as the algorithm sorts the array and the bars representing the numbers move to their sorted positions.
